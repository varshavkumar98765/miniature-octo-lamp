Part 1: A Galaxy Reawakens
The twin suns had long since set on the golden age of the Jedi, and the galaxy was not at peace. 
It had been thirty years since the fall of the Empire—since Darth Vader turned against his master and the Death 
Star crumbled into cosmic dust. Hope had kindled briefly, a spark held tightly in the hands of Luke Skywalker, 
Leia Organa, and Han Solo. But sparks are fragile things.

The Force Awakens begins not with fireworks, but with shadows. The First Order, born from the embers of imperial
ambition, has risen with terrifying speed. They march beneath the black banners of Supreme Leader Snoke, erasing worlds and memories alike.
Luke Skywalker, the last Jedi, has vanished. And the galaxy holds its breath.

Somewhere in the barren deserts of Jakku, a young woman survives by salvaging pieces of old wars. Rey, a scavenger with sand-streaked hands and wide,
watchful eyes, drags metallic scraps across endless dunes. She doesn’t know her past, nor her destiny—but she dreams of belonging. Each day she scratches
a tally mark inside her hollowed-out AT-AT shelter, another mark for another day waiting. For what, she doesn’t know.

At the same time, a Resistance pilot named Poe Dameron races against time, entrusted with a sliver of hope—a map leading to Luke Skywalker. 
The First Order descends on the village like a storm, led by a masked figure cloaked in menace: Kylo Ren. He is no mere villain. His presence 
is a paradox—a boy in a man’s armor, haunted by a legacy he both worships and despises.

In the chaos, Poe entrusts the map to a droid—BB-8, a roly-poly bundle of personality—and is captured.
BB-8 flees into the desert, carrying the secret that could change the fate of the galaxy.

Part 2: The Faces of a New Rebellion
While Rey scavenges for parts and lives off rations doled out like crumbs, fate is moving.
BB-8 crosses her path, rolling into her life with beeps and whirs, and for the first time, she has something to protect. She doesn’t yet know
that protecting others is the first step toward discovering oneself.

Elsewhere, a stormtrooper stands in a battlefield soaked with fire and fear. FN-2187 is his name—no, his designation. But something stirs
in him when he sees a comrade fall. Blood marks his helmet like a brand. He removes it—not out of disobedience, but revelation.
War isn't heroism. It's horror.

That stormtrooper becomes Finn. And when he helps Poe escape the clutches of the First Order in a daring flight,
Poe gives him the simplest gift a person can offer: a name. “You need a pilot,” Finn had said. What he really needed was purpose.

The trio converges—Finn, Rey, and BB-8—like stars pulled into orbit around one another. Their meeting is chaotic, accidental, full of near-misses and close calls. 
They steal the Millennium Falcon, not knowing its history, and tear across the stars, trying to outrun an enemy whose reach is vast.

Enter Han Solo. He boards the Falcon with blaster in hand, older now, eyes worn with loss. He sees in Rey and Finn the same stubborn courage that once drove him and Leia. 
They don’t know it yet, but they are inheriting something ancient—not just a ship, but a rebellion, a story, a war.
