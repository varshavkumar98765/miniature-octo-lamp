Uncharted 3.0 dummy repo...or is it?


Each file uses a different pattern to decode.

Use the numbers you got from solving the morse code as hints to decode the files.

# How to decode

This cipher is based on book cipher.

Say you get a set of numbers on multiplying the matrices as [ 123 , 456 , 5663 ]
This can mean ...

    123 is the 1st number, so use this for file 1. the letter needed is in 12th line, 23rd word and its 3rd letter
    It could also mean 1st line, 2nd word and its 3rd letter. 
    THIS IS UP TO YOU TO DECODE.
    5663 --> use 3rd file, 5th or 56th line, 6th or 66th word and 3rd letter.

Use space (' ') as a delimiter ( to separate words to count which word ).
