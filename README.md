_Uncharted 3.0 dummy repo... or is it?_

Each file in this repo uses a **different pattern** to decode.  
Use the numbers you obtained from solving the **Morse code** as clues to decipher the files.

## 🧩 How to Decode

This is a variation of a **book cipher**. Here's the idea:

Suppose your decoded numbers from the matrix multiplication step are:
[123, 456, 5663]



These numbers act as positional hints. Each number can be interpreted in multiple ways, and it's up to you to find the correct one.

### 🔢 Example Interpretation

Let’s break down `123`:
- Could mean:
  - **File 1**, **Line 12**, **Word 3**, **Letter (or character)**
  - OR: **Line 1**, **Word 2**, **Letter 3**
  - OR: **Line 1**, **Word 23**, **3rd letter**

Similarly, `5663` might be:
- **File 3**, **Line 56** or **Line 5**
- **Word 6** or **Word 66**
- **Letter 3**

### ✏️ Word Splitting Rule

- Use a single **space `' '`** as the delimiter to split each line into words.

## 🚨 Notes

- **Each file may use a different decoding style**, so don’t assume consistency.
- There may be **multiple plausible interpretations** — try a few and look for patterns or meaningful words.
- This is part of the challenge. Have fun and think like a cryptanalyst. 🕵️

Good luck decoding! 🧠🔓
