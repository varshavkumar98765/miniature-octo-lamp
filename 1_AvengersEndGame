The dim lights of the Avengers facility glinted off the polished metal of the Quantum suits. The team stood in a circle on the platform, each of them tense, determined. 
Bruce Banner, now in his calm, confident Professor Hulk form, adjusted the settings on the control console. Tony Stark, as usual, couldn't resist breaking the tension.

“So, we’re really doing this,” Tony muttered, pulling his helmet back and glancing at the others. “Time travel. No do-overs.”

Scott Lang shifted nervously in his suit. “Wait, are we sure we’ve got the math right? Because I still remember the whole turning-into-a-baby thing.”

Banner raised a brow. “Relax, Scott. That was… an early glitch.”

Rhodey grinned. “What’s the plan if we run into our past selves? Do we fight them? I’ve always wanted to punch the 2012 me.”

Steve Rogers stepped forward, his expression steady. “No. No fighting unless we have to. We stay out of the way. In and out. Get the stones. Bring them back.”

“Yeah,” Natasha added, her voice quiet but firm. “No mistakes. No attachments.”

Thor, leaning on Stormbreaker and trying to mask his nerves, gave a shaky smile. “Let’s just make sure I don’t run into my mother. Or… maybe I do. I mean, what’s the worst that could happen?”

Clint Barton gave him a look. “You crying in the middle of a heist?”

Tony clapped his hands. “Alright, gang. Enough sentimentality. Let’s make history. Or rather… unmake it.”

Banner counted them down. “Sync in… three… two…”

Each Avenger took one last look at their teammates. Time suits powered up, the Quantum GPS devices lit green, and the whirring of the platform filled the chamber.

“One.”

In a flash of light and energy, they vanished — scattered across time, on a mission to retrieve the six Infinity Stones before Thanos ever could.
